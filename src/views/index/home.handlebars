        <p><strong>Dear Straws Users,</strong></p>
        <p>
            Since I created this app, thousands of you have used it to help better manage your IG. Recently, Straws has had a huge increase
            in the number of users using it every single day. I am writing to let you know that, unfortunately, the app's functionality has 
            been handicapped by this new demand. I am unsure when the issues caused by this demand will be resolved, as they are out of my 
            control. If these issues are ever resolved, I will re-enable the app. Thank you for continuing to use Straws! I hope that these
            issues will be resolved, soon.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p>
        <p>Straws</p>
